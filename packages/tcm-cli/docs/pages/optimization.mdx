# Optimizations

Aside from just bundling your module into different formats, TCM comes with some optimizations for your convenience. They yield objectively better code and smaller bundle sizes.

After TCM compiles your code with TypeScript, it processes your code with 3 Babel plugins:

- [`babel-plugin-annotate-pure-calls`](https://github.com/Andarist/babel-plugin-annotate-pure-calls): Injects for `#__PURE` annotations to enable treeshaking
- [`babel-plugin-dev-expressions`](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/babel-plugin-dev-expression): A mirror of Facebook's dev-expression Babel plugin. It reduces or eliminates development checks from production code
- [`babel-plugin-rename-import`](https://github.com/laat/babel-plugin-transform-rename-import): Used to rewrite any `lodash` imports

## Dev-only Expressions


`babel-plugin-annotate-pure-calls` + `babel-plugin-dev-expressions` work together to fully eliminate dead code (aka treeshake) development checks from your production code. Let's look at an example to see how it works.

Imagine our source code is just this:

```tsx
// ./src/index.ts
export const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    console.log('Helpful dev-only error message');
  }
  return a + b;
};
```

> `tcm build` will output an ES module file and 3 CommonJS files (dev, prod, and an entry file). If you want to specify a UMD build, you can do that as well. For brevity, let's examine the CommonJS output (comments added for emphasis):

```js
// Entry File
// ./dist/index.js
'use strict';

// This determines which build to use based on the `NODE_ENV` of your end user.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  module.exports = require('./mylib.cjs.production.js');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./mylib.cjs.development.js');
}
```

```js
// CommonJS Development Build
// ./dist/mylib.cjs.development.js
'use strict';

const sum = (a, b) => {
  {
    console.log('Helpful dev-only error message');
  }

  return a + b;
};

exports.sum = sum;
//# sourceMappingURL=mylib.cjs.development.js.map
```

```js
// CommonJS Production Build
// ./dist/mylib.cjs.production.js
'use strict';
exports.sum = (s, t) => s + t;
//# sourceMappingURL=test-react-tcm-cli.cjs.production.js.map
```

As you can see, TCM stripped out the development check from the production code. **This allows you to safely add development-only behavior (like more useful error messages) without any production bundle size impact.**

For ESM build, it's up to end-user to build environment specific build with NODE_ENV replace (done by Webpack 4 automatically).

### Rollup Treeshaking

TCM's rollup config [removes getters and setters on objects](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx/blob/1f6a1b6819bb17678aa417f0df5349bec12f59ac/src/createRollupConfig.ts#L73) so that property access has no side effects. Don't do it.

### Advanced `babel-plugin-dev-expressions`

TCM will use `babel-plugin-dev-expressions` to make the following replacements _before_ treeshaking.

`__DEV__`

Replaces

```ts
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('foo');
}
```

with

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  console.log('foo');
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** To use `__DEV__` in TypeScript, you need to add `declare var __DEV__: boolean` somewhere in your project's type path (e.g. `./types/index.d.ts`).

```ts
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;
```

> **Note:** The `dev-expression` transform does not run when `NODE_ENV` is `test`. As such, if you use `__DEV__`, you will need to define it as a global constant in your test environment.

#### `invariant`

Replaces

```js
invariant(condition, 'error message here');
```

with

```js
if (!condition) {
  if ('production' !== process.env.NODE_ENV) {
    invariant(false, 'error message here');
  } else {
    invariant(false);
  }
}
```

Note: TCM doesn't supply an `invariant` function for you, you need to import one yourself. We recommend https://github.com/alexreardon/tiny-invariant.

To extract and minify `invariant` error codes in production into a static `codes.json` file, specify the `--extractErrors` flag in command line. For more details see [Error extraction docs](#error-extraction).

#### `warning`

Replaces

```js
warning(condition, 'dev warning here');
```

with

```js
if ('production' !== process.env.NODE_ENV) {
  warning(condition, 'dev warning here');
}
```

Note: TCM doesn't supply a `warning` function for you, you need to import one yourself. We recommend https://github.com/alexreardon/tiny-warning.

## Using lodash

If you want to use a lodash function in your package, TCM will help you do it the _right_ way so that your library does not get fat shamed on Twitter. However, before you continue, seriously consider rolling whatever function you are about to use on your own. Anyways, here is how to do it right.

First, install `lodash` and `lodash-es` as _dependencies_

```bash
yarn add lodash lodash-es
```

Now install `@types/lodash` to your development dependencies.

```bash
yarn add @types/lodash --dev
```

Import your lodash method however you want, TCM will optimize it like so.

```tsx
// ./src/index.ts
import kebabCase from 'lodash/kebabCase';

export const KebabLogger = (msg: string) => {
  console.log(kebabCase(msg));
};
```

For brevity let's look at the ES module output.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import o from"lodash-es/kebabCase";const e=e=>{console.log(o(e))};export{e as KebabLogger};
//# sourceMappingURL=test-react-tcm-cli.esm.production.js.map
```

TCM will rewrite your `import kebabCase from 'lodash/kebabCase'` to `import o from 'lodash-es/kebabCase'`. This allows your library to be treeshakable to end consumers while allowing to you to use `@types/lodash` for free.

> Note: TCM will also transform destructured imports. For example, `import { kebabCase } from 'lodash'` would have also been transformed to `import o from "lodash-es/kebabCase".

## Error extraction

After running `--extractErrors`, you will have a `./errors/codes.json` file with all your extracted `invariant` error codes. This process scans your production code and swaps out your `invariant` error message strings for a corresponding error code (just like React!). This extraction only works if your error checking/warning is done by a function called `invariant`.

Note: We don't provide this function for you, it is up to you how you want it to behave. For example, you can use either `tiny-invariant` or `tiny-warning`, but you must then import the module as a variable called `invariant` and it should have the same type signature.

⚠️Don't forget: you will need to host the decoder somewhere. Once you have a URL, look at `./errors/ErrorProd.js` and replace the `reactjs.org` URL with yours.

> Known issue: our `transformErrorMessages` babel plugin currently doesn't have sourcemap support, so you will see "Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect" warnings. [We would love your help on this.](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx/issues/184)
